# Summary:

## The game play will be simple.

* There will be a simple square game board divided into nine tiles or grid spaces.
* When the player clicks on one of the grid spaces, it will be assigned either an "X" or an "O".
* The game is over when one player claims 3 grid spaces in a row or there are no moves left.
* At the start of the game, the board will not be active until the first player has chosen whether they are to play "X" or "O".
* A panel will indicate whose turn it is. When the game is over, a banner will display the winner or announce a draw if no one wins.
* A restart button will be displayed when the game is over, returning the game to the starting state when clicked.
